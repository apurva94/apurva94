I put my trust in a tin foiled crate and just to dear to my heart
We talked of goals and passions of life, it was my frirend or atleast that's what I thought
In a world full of fake smiles and empty promises, I found a blunt believable lie
It did its best to guide me I guess, but could never communicate WHY
Now we are lost, its too late to turn back, I wasn't keeping track "Oh great!"
And now I depend on it to take me home, but alas its just a tin foiled crate
