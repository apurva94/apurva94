  <h1>The Present (2024): What is a Standard AI model?</h1>
  In a standard model, in order to meet productivity and ethical standards simultaneously, one is burdened with developing a complicated objective, 
  taking into account every possible variable, interactions between them and outcomes. It becomes difficult to ensure all undesired behaviors are punished.

  <h1>The Future Uncertain AI</h1>
  These models can achieve goals under uncertainty and have the following strengths:
  <ul>
    <li>Working on the bigger picture: Instead of focusing on a fixed objective, the model can be more aware of its actions' consequences in the real world and consider a constantly changing environment. Hence if any variable that might have been missed in a standard models objective can be accounted for here.
    </li> 
    <li>Asking questions to reduce uncertainity about goal: A user can guide the model on their personal preference and expectations of the model and communicate the desired goal. Further, if the model has not learned the correct goal, this can be modeled in the computation, and the model can be aware that its objective is incorrect. This results in the training process being user-centric and removes ethical burden of specifying a perfect objective which may not take individual preference into account
    </li>
    <li>Getting user permission:Most of the ethical burden can be shifted from the developer to the user by asking for information before realizing the model's action. If the goal is uncertain, the model will ask for more feedback and the user can guide it to a objective they are comfortable achieve. This avoids unsafe and unethical situations from occuring.
    </li>
  </ul>
