<h1>Post-Hoc to Ante-Hoc GNN Explainability</h1>
<p>Let's go on the journey and our main stops are the following: Creation of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Explaining GNNs, Main challenges and solutions, Post-Hoc explainability and Ante-Hoc explainability.  </p>
<p>The scariest part of the journey for me is the jargon so I will do my best to keep things simple, understandable and fun. </p>
<p>And who am I? - A fellow traveller wanting to make the journey easier of others. </p>
