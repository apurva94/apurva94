<h1>Post-Hoc to Ante-Hoc GNN Explainability</h1>
<p>Let's go on the journey and our main stops are the following: Creation of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Explaining GNNs, Main challenges and solutions, Post-Hoc explainability and Ante-Hoc explainability.  </p>
<p>The scariest part of the journey for me is the jargon so I will do my best to keep things simple, understandable and fun. </p>
<p>And who am I? - A fellow traveller wanting to make the journey easier of others. </p> 

<h1>Let first Define the GNN</h1>
<p>This is going to be the most crucial piece of information needed to visualize the terrain ahead. <br> A GNN is a structured combination of learning blocks. The holy grail to understand this family of models is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08434.pdf">The review paper by Jie Zhou et.al</a>
<br>. In practice graph neural networks are pretty similar to social networks. A person gains information about the world from their surrondings and is in something known as the collection phase. Then they choose a way to combine all that information, some may treat everyones opinion equally, some may ignore that nosy neighbor and listen to the daily news. 
<br> As the days go by each one learn what is called aggregation of information. Finally, each day, each second we all are changing, we are updating ourselves and will use the updated knowledge to talk to people. </p>
