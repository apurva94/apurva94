<h1>Reparameterization</h1>
<p>When we want to learn a discrete distribution, we are faced with a discontinuous loss surface. This means that local gradients cannot be calculated. <br>
  This is why we assume the discrete values is actually a result of a continuous distribution with parameters Î¸. This is called reparameterization. <br>
  A common approach is to use Monte Carlo approximation which adds noise to get an approximate instantiation of the distribution
